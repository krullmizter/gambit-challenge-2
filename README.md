# Gambit challenge #2 (attempt) 
#### Made by: Samuel Granvik

### Option 2: Web or native app
"If the data conversion path in option 1 is not something that interests you, or you prefer a more graphical solution, create an app that retrieves and parses the data and presents it as is. The key point is to make use of data available in a backend, and present it in a mobile friendly way."

### About
This was my "middle" attempt at the gambit challenge #2. This is the [main](https://github.com/krullmizter/gambit-app) submission, and the working one. This one is practically the same as the main solution, using Vue, Gridsome and GraphQL. But this solution only uses the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework to style the web-app. I wanted to take advantage of the material design, and their pre-made solution to the table model. This would allow me to use pre-built filtering, pagination and sorting for the data. I began working on this but later gave up to do it on my own.
